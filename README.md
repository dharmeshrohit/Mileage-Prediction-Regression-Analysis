**Source**:
This Dataset was taken the StatLib library which is maintained at carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Experience.

**Dataset Information:**
This Dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 if the original instances were removed because they had unknown values of the "mpg" attribute. The original Dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".

"The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in the term of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes." (Quinlan 1993)

**Attribute Information**
1. mpg: continuous
2. cylinder: multi-valued discrete
3. displacement: continuous
4. horsepower: continuous
5. weight: continuous
6. acceleration: continuous
7. model year: multi-valued discrete
8. origin: multi-valued discrete
9. car name: string (unique for each instance)
